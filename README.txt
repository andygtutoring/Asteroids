NOTE: This is still in development. There are probably errors.

I haven't had much experience using the <canvas> element.
I wanted to create a game that uses the <canvas> element.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: "Create a fun game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the <canvas> element to create the game world for the player. The game should work on mobile devices (without a keyboard), and can be of any genre or style or story that you want. It can be simple, easy, hard, complicated, whatever works, but focus on really using the canvas element in interesting ways."

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:
Here's a simple yet engaging game that utilizes the canvas element, suitable for mobile devices.
Game: "Galaxy Collector"
Game Description
Navigate a spaceship through a vibrant, starry night sky, collecting stars while avoiding asteroids.

Open the HTML file in a web browser to play the game.

Here are example use cases and game development considerations:
Example Use Cases
1. Mobile Gameplay: Play the game on mobile devices by tapping or dragging to control the spaceship.
2. Desktop Gameplay: Play the game on desktop using a mouse or trackpad.
3. Score Challenge: Compete with friends to achieve the highest score.
4. Obstacle Course: Create levels with predefined asteroid patterns.
Game Development Considerations
1. Collision Detection: Enhance collision detection for more precise star collection and asteroid avoidance.
2. Power-Ups: Introduce power-ups like shields, speed boosts or star magnets.
3. Level Progression: Design multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
4. Smooth Animations: Implement smoother animations for stars, asteroids and the spaceship.
5. Sound Effects: Add sound effects for collisions, star collection and background music.
6. Visual Enhancements: Incorporate vibrant backgrounds, particle effects or glowing trails.
7. Gameplay Variations: Experiment with different spaceship controls or gravity effects.
8. Multiplayer: Develop multiplayer capabilities for competitive gameplay.
Future Development
1. Advanced AI: Implement AI-controlled spaceships for competitive gameplay.
2. Customization: Allow players to customize their spaceships.
3. Online Leaderboards: Create online leaderboards to track top scores.
4. Game Expansion: Expand the game with new features, levels or game modes.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
